## Conclusion

Both PP-YOLOE+ and Ultralytics YOLO11 are highly capable anchor-free object detection models. PP-YOLOE+ offers strong performance, especially for users embedded within the Baidu PaddlePaddle ecosystem.

However, **Ultralytics YOLO11 is generally recommended** due to its superior balance of speed and accuracy across multiple hardware platforms (as seen in TensorRT speeds), exceptional versatility supporting various vision tasks beyond detection, and significantly more user-friendly and well-maintained ecosystem. The ease of use, extensive documentation, active community support, lower parameter counts for comparable accuracy (e.g., YOLO11x vs PP-YOLOE+x), and seamless integration with tools like [Ultralytics HUB](https://docs.ultralytics.com/hub/) make YOLO11 an outstanding choice for both researchers and developers aiming for efficient development and deployment of state-of-the-art computer vision solutions.
