## Model Architectures

**YOLOv7** builds upon previous YOLO versions, known for their speed and efficiency. It employs an architecture focused on optimized network aggregation and utilizes techniques like Extended Efficient Layer Aggregation Networks (E-ELAN) to enhance learning without increasing inference cost. YOLOv7 is designed for powerful and efficient object detection, suitable for various applications requiring real-time analysis.

**YOLO11**, the latest iteration from Ultralytics, represents a significant step forward. It is engineered for even greater accuracy and efficiency. While specific architectural details are continuously evolving, YOLO11 emphasizes enhanced feature extraction and optimized network design. One of the key improvements in YOLO11 is achieving higher Mean Average Precision (mAP) with fewer parameters compared to previous models like YOLOv8. This leads to faster processing speeds and reduced computational costs, making it ideal for real-time applications and deployment on edge devices. [Ultralytics YOLO11 has arrived!
