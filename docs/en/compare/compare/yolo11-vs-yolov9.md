## Ultralytics YOLO11: The Cutting Edge

[Ultralytics YOLO11](https://docs.ultralytics.com/models/yolo11/), authored by Glenn Jocher and Jing Qiu from Ultralytics and released on 2024-09-27, represents the latest advancement in the YOLO series. Building upon the foundation of previous models like [YOLOv8](https://docs.ultralytics.com/models/yolov8/), YOLO11 is engineered for enhanced accuracy and efficiency across various computer vision tasks including object detection, [instance segmentation](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/instance-segmentation), [image classification](https://docs.ultralytics.com/tasks/classify/), and [pose estimation](https://docs.ultralytics.com/tasks/pose/).

**Architecture and Features:** YOLO11's architecture is designed for superior feature extraction and faster processing. It achieves higher accuracy with fewer parameters, making it ideal for real-time applications on diverse platforms, from edge devices like [NVIDIA Jetson](https://docs.ultralytics.com/guides/nvidia-jetson/) to cloud systems. It maintains task compatibility with YOLOv8, ensuring ease of transition for existing users.

**Performance:** YOLO11 models offer a range of performance profiles. For example, YOLO11m achieves a mAPval50-95 of 51.5 at a 640 image size, with an inference speed of 183.2ms on CPU (ONNX) and 4.7ms on T4 TensorRT10. Its parameter size is 20.1M and FLOPs are 68.0B. This balance positions YOLO11 as a versatile option for applications requiring both accuracy and speed.

**Use Cases:** YOLO11 is particularly well-suited for scenarios demanding high precision and real-time processing, such as [traffic management](https://www.ultralytics.com/blog/optimizingtraffic-management-with-ultralytics-yolo11) in smart cities, [medical image analysis](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/medical-image-analysis) for diagnostics, and [quality control](https://www.ultralytics.com/solutions/ai-in-manufacturing) in manufacturing.
