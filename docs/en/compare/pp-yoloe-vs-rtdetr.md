**Analysis:** PP-YOLOE+ generally offers faster inference speeds, especially the smaller variants (+s, +t), making them highly suitable for resource-constrained environments. RTDETRv2 models tend to provide higher mAP for comparable parameter counts or FLOPs, showcasing the accuracy benefits of the transformer architecture, although often at the cost of slightly slower inference and higher computational requirements during training. PP-YOLOE+x achieves the highest mAP in this comparison, while PP-YOLOE+s offers the fastest TensorRT speed.

## Conclusion

Both PP-YOLOE+ and RTDETRv2 are powerful object detection models from Baidu. PP-YOLOE+ excels in efficiency and speed, making it ideal for real-time applications within the PaddlePaddle ecosystem. RTDETRv2 offers potentially higher accuracy due to its transformer architecture, suited for complex scenes where contextual understanding is key, but may demand more computational resources.
