## YOLOv10: The Cutting-Edge Real-Time Detector

[YOLOv10](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14458), introduced in May 2024 by Ao Wang, Hui Chen, Lihao Liu, et al. from Tsinghua University, is the latest iteration in the YOLO series, focusing on real-time end-to-end object detection without Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS). It aims to enhance efficiency and accuracy through architectural innovations and optimized components.

**Architecture and Key Features:**

YOLOv10 boasts a redesigned architecture that emphasizes efficiency and accuracy. Key improvements include consistent dual assignments for NMS-free training and holistic efficiency-accuracy driven model design. This results in reduced computational redundancy and enhanced model capability, leading to faster inference and improved performance metrics. The model is implemented in PyTorch and is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/THU-MIG/yolov10).

**Performance Metrics:**

YOLOv10 demonstrates state-of-the-art performance with significantly reduced latency and model size compared to previous YOLO versions and other real-time detectors. For instance, YOLOv10-S is reported to be 1.8x faster than RT-DETR-R18 with similar Average Precision (AP) on COCO, while having 2.8x fewer parameters and FLOPs.
