**Key Metrics:**

- **mAP (Mean Average Precision):** Indicates the accuracy of object detection. Higher mAP values signify better accuracy. Refer to the [YOLO Performance Metrics guide](https://docs.ultralytics.com/guides/yolo-performance-metrics/) for a detailed explanation.
- **Speed (Inference Time):** Measured in milliseconds (ms), this indicates the time taken for a model to process one image. Lower values mean faster inference, crucial for real-time applications.
- **Params (Parameters):** The number of parameters in a model. Smaller models are generally faster and require less memory.
- **FLOPs (Floating Point Operations):** A measure of computational complexity. Lower FLOPs indicate more efficient computation.
