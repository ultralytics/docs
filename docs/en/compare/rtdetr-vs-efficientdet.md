## RTDETRv2: Real-Time Detection Transformer v2

**RTDETRv2** is a cutting-edge, real-time object detection model that leverages a Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture. It's designed for high accuracy and efficient inference, making it suitable for applications requiring rapid and precise object recognition. RTDETR models represent a significant advancement in object detection, moving towards transformer-based architectures that can capture global context more effectively than traditional CNNs.
