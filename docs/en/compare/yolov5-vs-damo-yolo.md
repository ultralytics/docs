YOLOv5 demonstrates excellent inference speed, particularly the smaller variants (YOLOv5n, YOLOv5s) on both CPU and GPU (TensorRT), making it highly suitable for real-time and edge deployment. DAMO-YOLO achieves competitive mAP scores, with its large variant slightly edging out YOLOv5x in mAP<sup>val</sup> 50-95, but lacks reported CPU inference speeds, potentially indicating a focus on GPU performance. YOLOv5 offers a wider range of models, providing flexibility for balancing speed, size, and accuracy.

## Conclusion: Choosing the Right Model

DAMO-YOLO and YOLOv5 cater to different priorities. DAMO-YOLO pushes for higher accuracy using novel architectural components. However, Ultralytics YOLOv5 stands out for its exceptional balance of speed, efficiency, and ease of use. Its scalability across different model sizes, extensive documentation, active community, and seamless integration within the Ultralytics ecosystem (including [Ultralytics HUB](https://www.ultralytics.com/hub)) make it a highly practical and developer-friendly choice, especially for real-time applications and deployment on diverse hardware, including edge devices.

For users seeking the latest advancements with similar ease of use and ecosystem benefits, newer Ultralytics models like [YOLOv8](https://docs.ultralytics.com/models/yolov8/) and [YOLO11](https://docs.ultralytics.com/models/yolo11/) build upon YOLOv5's strengths, offering improved performance and anchor-free architectures.
