## Ultralytics YOLO11

[Ultralytics YOLO11](https://docs.ultralytics.com/models/yolo11/) is the latest iteration in the renowned YOLO (You Only Look Once) series, known for its speed and efficiency in object detection tasks. YOLO11 builds upon previous YOLO versions by introducing architectural refinements aimed at enhancing both accuracy and speed. It maintains the one-stage detection paradigm, processing the entire image in a single pass, which contributes to its real-time performance capabilities. YOLO11 supports various computer vision tasks including [object detection](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/object-detection), [instance segmentation](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/instance-segmentation), [image classification](https://docs.ultralytics.com/tasks/classify/), and [pose estimation](https://docs.ultralytics.com/tasks/pose/).

**Architecture and Key Features:**

YOLO11's architecture focuses on optimizing the balance between model size and accuracy. Key improvements include enhanced feature extraction layers for more detailed feature capture and a streamlined network structure to reduce computational overhead. This results in models that are not only faster but also more parameter-efficient. The architecture is designed to be flexible, allowing for deployment across diverse platforms, from edge devices like [NVIDIA Jetson](https://docs.ultralytics.com/guides/nvidia-jetson/) and [Raspberry Pi](https://docs.ultralytics.com/guides/raspberry-pi/) to cloud servers. YOLO11 is also easily integrated with platforms like [Ultralytics HUB](https://www.ultralytics.com/hub) for streamlined training and deployment workflows.

**Performance Metrics:**

As shown in the comparison table, YOLO11 offers a range of models (n, s, m, l, x) to cater to different performance requirements. For instance, YOLO11n, the nano version, achieves a mAPval50-95 of 39.5 with a very small model size of 2.6M parameters and impressive CPU ONNX speed of 56.1ms, making it suitable for resource-constrained environments. Larger models like YOLO11x reach a mAPval50-95 of 54.7, demonstrating higher accuracy at the cost of increased model size and inference time. YOLO11 leverages techniques like [mixed precision](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/mixed-precision) training to further boost speed without significant accuracy loss.

**Strengths:**

- **Speed and Efficiency**: Excellent inference speed, suitable for real-time applications.
- **Accuracy**: Achieves high mAP, especially with larger model variants.
- **Versatility**: Supports multiple computer vision tasks.
- **Ease of Use**: Seamless integration with the Ultralytics ecosystem and [Python package](https://docs.ultralytics.com/usage/python/).
- **Deployment Flexibility**: Optimized for various hardware platforms.

**Weaknesses:**

- **Potential trade-off between speed and accuracy**: Nano and small versions prioritize speed over top-tier accuracy.
- **One-stage limitations**: Like other one-stage detectors, it may have slight limitations in handling very small objects compared to some two-stage detectors.

**Ideal Use Cases:**

YOLO11 excels in applications requiring real-time object detection, such as:

- **Distillation Enhancement**: Incorporates knowledge distillation techniques to further refine the model and boost performance.

These architectural choices collectively aim to create a model that is both fast and highly accurate, addressing the critical needs of real-world object detection scenarios.

**Performance Metrics:**

DAMO-YOLO offers different model sizes (tiny, small, medium, large), each providing a trade-off between speed and accuracy. As shown in the comparison table, DAMO-YOLO models achieve competitive mAP scores. For instance, DAMO-YOLOl reaches a mAP<sup>val</sup><sub>50-95</sub> of 50.8. The models are designed for efficient inference, with the smaller variants being particularly suitable for resource-constrained environments. DAMO-YOLO's performance is evaluated on standard datasets like COCO, demonstrating its effectiveness in complex object detection tasks.
