RTDETRv2 leverages a **Vision Transformer (ViT)** backbone, a departure from traditional CNN-based architectures. As detailed in our [Vision Transformer (ViT) glossary page](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/vision-transformer-vit), ViTs excel at capturing long-range dependencies within images, enhancing contextual understanding for potentially higher accuracy in complex scenes. The architecture combines transformer encoders with CNN decoders to balance speed and precision, employing an [anchor-free detection](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/anchor-free-detectors) approach.

### Strengths

- **High Accuracy:** Transformer architecture enables superior feature extraction for state-of-the-art accuracy.
- **Contextual Understanding:** Excels at capturing global context, beneficial in complex visual scenarios like [autonomous vehicles](https://www.ultralytics.com/solutions/ai-in-automotive).
- **Efficient Inference:** Optimized for real-time performance, balancing accuracy and speed.

### Weaknesses

- **Complexity:** Transformer architectures can be more intricate than traditional CNNs.
- **Resource Intensive:** Larger variants demand significant computational resources, especially during training, often requiring more CUDA memory and longer training times compared to efficient CNN models like Ultralytics YOLO.

RTDETRv2 is well-suited for applications demanding high accuracy and real-time processing, such as advanced robotics and high-precision industrial inspection, as discussed in our [AI in Manufacturing blog](https://www.ultralytics.com/blog/improving-manufacturing-with-computer-vision).
