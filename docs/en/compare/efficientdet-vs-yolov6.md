## Architectural Overview

**EfficientDet** models, part of the EfficientDet family, are renowned for their **bi-directional Feature Pyramid Network (BiFPN)** and **compound scaling**. BiFPN enables efficient feature fusion across different network levels, enhancing the model's ability to detect objects at various scales. Compound scaling systematically scales up network depth, width, and resolution, optimizing for both accuracy and efficiency.

**YOLOv6-3.0**, on the other hand, represents the evolution of the **YOLO (You Only Look Once)** series, known for its speed and real-time object detection capabilities. YOLOv6-3.0 focuses on streamlining the architecture for enhanced inference speed while maintaining competitive accuracy. It typically employs a single-stage detection approach, directly predicting bounding boxes and class probabilities from feature maps, prioritizing speed and efficiency.
