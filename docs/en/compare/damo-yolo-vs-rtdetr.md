## RTDETRv2: High Accuracy Real-Time Detection

**RTDETRv2** ([Real-Time Detection Transformer v2](https://docs.ultralytics.com/models/rtdetr/)) is a cutting-edge object detection model known for its high accuracy and real-time capabilities. Developed by Baidu and detailed in their [Arxiv paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.08069) released on 2023-04-17 by authors Wenyu Lv, Yian Zhao, Qinyao Chang, Kui Huang, Guanzhong Wang, and Yi Liu, RTDETRv2 leverages a Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture to achieve state-of-the-art performance. The [official implementation](https://github.com/lyuwenyu/RT-DETR/tree/main/rtdetrv2_pytorch) is available on GitHub.

### Architecture and Key Features

RTDETRv2 employs a transformer-based architecture, enabling it to capture global context within images, leading to improved accuracy, especially in complex scenes. Unlike traditional Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Vision Transformers leverage self-attention mechanisms to weigh the importance of different image regions, enhancing feature extraction. This anchor-free approach simplifies the detection process and can improve generalization across diverse datasets, as discussed in our glossary on [anchor-free detectors](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/anchor-free-detectors).

### Performance Metrics

As indicated in the comparison table below, RTDETRv2 models offer impressive mAP scores, particularly the larger variants like RTDETRv2-x, achieving a mAPval50-95 of 54.3. Inference speeds on TensorRT are also competitive, making it suitable for real-time applications when deployed on capable hardware like NVIDIA T4 GPUs. For detailed metrics and understanding of performance evaluation, refer to the [YOLO Performance Metrics guide](https://docs.ultralytics.com/guides/yolo-performance-metrics/).
