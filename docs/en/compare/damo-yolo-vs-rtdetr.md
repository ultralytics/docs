- **Hybrid Design:** Often combines CNNs for initial feature extraction with transformer layers for global context modeling.
- **Anchor-Free Detection:** Simplifies the detection pipeline by eliminating the need for predefined anchor boxes, similar to [anchor-free detectors](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/anchor-free-detectors).

This architecture allows RTDETRv2 to achieve high accuracy, particularly in complex scenes.

### Performance Metrics

RTDETRv2 models excel in accuracy, with the RTDETRv2-x variant reaching a mAP<sup>val</sup> 50-95 of 54.3. While generally larger and more computationally intensive than DAMO-YOLO, RTDETRv2 maintains competitive inference speeds, especially when accelerated with [TensorRT](https://docs.ultralytics.com/integrations/tensorrt/) on capable hardware like NVIDIA T4 GPUs.

## Ultralytics YOLO Models: A Strong Alternative

While DAMO-YOLO offers speed and RTDETRv2 excels in accuracy, [Ultralytics YOLO](https://www.ultralytics.com/yolo) models like [YOLOv8](https://docs.ultralytics.com/models/yolov8/) and [YOLO11](https://docs.ultralytics.com/models/yolo11/) provide a compelling balance of performance, efficiency, and usability. Ultralytics models benefit from a streamlined user experience via a simple API and extensive [documentation](https://docs.ultralytics.com/guides/). They are part of a well-maintained ecosystem with active development, strong community support, and frequent updates available through the [Ultralytics HUB](https://www.ultralytics.com/hub). Ultralytics YOLO models often achieve a favorable trade-off between speed and accuracy, suitable for diverse real-world deployments.
