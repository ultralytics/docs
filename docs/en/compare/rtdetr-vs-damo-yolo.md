## RTDETRv2: Transformer-Based High-Accuracy Detection

**RTDETRv2** ([Real-Time Detection Transformer v2](https://github.com/lyuwenyu/RT-DETR/tree/main/rtdetrv2_pytorch#readme)) is a state-of-the-art object detection model developed by Baidu, known for its high accuracy and efficient real-time performance. Introduced on 2023-04-17 in the paper "[DETRs Beat YOLOs on Real-time Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.08069)" by Wenyu Lv, Yian Zhao, Qinyao Chang, Kui Huang, Guanzhong Wang, and Yi Liu, RTDETRv2 leverages a Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture to achieve robust feature extraction and global context understanding.

### Architecture and Features

RTDETRv2 distinguishes itself with its transformer-based architecture, enabling it to capture global context within images more effectively than traditional CNN-based detectors. This architecture allows for superior accuracy, especially in complex scenes where understanding the broader context is crucial. The model is implemented in PyTorch and is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/lyuwenyu/RT-DETR/tree/main/rtdetrv2_pytorch).

### Performance

RTDETRv2 demonstrates impressive performance metrics, achieving a mAPval50-95 of 54.3 for its largest variant, RTDETRv2-x. Inference speeds are also competitive, making it suitable for real-time applications when using capable hardware.
