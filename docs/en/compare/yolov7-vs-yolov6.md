_Note: Speed benchmarks can vary based on hardware, software ([TensorRT](https://docs.ultralytics.com/integrations/tensorrt/), [ONNX](https://docs.ultralytics.com/integrations/onnx/), [OpenVINO](https://docs.ultralytics.com/integrations/openvino/)), batch size, and specific configurations. mAP values are typically reported on the COCO val dataset._

Based on the table, YOLOv7x achieves the highest mAP, indicating superior accuracy. However, YOLOv6-3.0 models, particularly the smaller variants like YOLOv6-3.0n, offer significantly faster inference speeds, especially on GPU with TensorRT optimization, and have fewer parameters and FLOPs, making them highly efficient. The choice depends on whether the priority is maximum accuracy (YOLOv7) or optimal speed/efficiency (YOLOv6-3.0).

For users seeking state-of-the-art models within a comprehensive and easy-to-use ecosystem, Ultralytics offers [YOLOv8](https://docs.ultralytics.com/models/yolov8/) and the latest [YOLO11](https://docs.ultralytics.com/models/yolo11/). These models provide strong performance across various tasks (detection, segmentation, pose, classification) and benefit from extensive documentation, active development, and integration with tools like [Ultralytics HUB](https://docs.ultralytics.com/hub/). You might also find comparisons with other models like [YOLOX](https://docs.ultralytics.com/compare/yolov7-vs-yolox/) and [RT-DETR](https://docs.ultralytics.com/compare/yolov7-vs-rtdetr/) insightful.
