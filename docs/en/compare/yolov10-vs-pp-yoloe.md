## Ultralytics YOLOv10

[Ultralytics YOLOv10](https://docs.ultralytics.com/models/yolov10/) is the latest iteration in the YOLO series, developed by Ao Wang, Hui Chen, Lihao Liu, et al. from Tsinghua University and released on 2024-05-23. It focuses on real-time end-to-end object detection, enhancing both performance and efficiency.

### Architecture and Key Features

YOLOv10, detailed in its [arXiv paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14458) and [GitHub repository](https://github.com/THU-MIG/yolov10), adopts an anchor-free detection method to simplify the architecture and speed up processing. Key features include:

- **Anchor-Free Approach**: By removing predefined anchor boxes, YOLOv10 streamlines training and inference, improving generalization.
- **Efficient Model Design**: Utilizes optimized backbone networks and layer designs to maximize feature extraction while minimizing computational cost.
- **Scalable Model Variants**: Offers a range of model sizes, from Nano to Extra-large, catering to various deployment needs from edge devices to cloud servers.

### Performance Metrics

YOLOv10 achieves a balance of speed and accuracy. Key performance indicators include:

- **mAP**: Up to 54.4% mAP<sup>val</sup><sub>50-95</sub> on the COCO dataset with YOLOv10x variant. Refer to [YOLO Performance Metrics](https://docs.ultralytics.com/guides/yolo-performance-metrics/) for details on mAP.
- **Inference Speed**: YOLOv10n achieves 1.56ms latency on T4 TensorRT10, as detailed in [OpenVINO Latency vs Throughput Modes](https://docs.ultralytics.com/guides/optimizing-openvino-latency-vs-throughput-modes/).
- **Model Size**: Sizes range from 2.3M parameters (YOLOv10n) to 56.9M (YOLOv10x).

### Use Cases

YOLOv10's real-time performance and scalability make it suitable for diverse applications:
