## RTDETRv2: High Accuracy Real-Time Detection

**RTDETRv2** ([Real-Time Detection Transformer v2](https://docs.ultralytics.com/models/rtdetr/)) is an advanced object detection model prioritizing high accuracy and real-time performance. Developed by Baidu and detailed in their [Arxiv paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17140) released in July 2024, RTDETRv2 builds upon a Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture to achieve state-of-the-art results in scenarios demanding precise object localization and classification.

### Architecture and Key Features

RTDETRv2's architecture leverages the strengths of transformers, enabling it to capture global context within images through self-attention mechanisms. This transformer-based approach allows the model to weigh the importance of different image regions, leading to enhanced feature extraction and improved accuracy, particularly in complex scenes. Unlike traditional Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), RTDETRv2 excels in understanding the broader context of an image, contributing to its robust detection capabilities. The [RT-DETR GitHub repository](https://github.com/lyuwenyu/RT-DETR/tree/main/rtdetrv2_pytorch) provides further details on its implementation.

### Performance Metrics

RTDETRv2 demonstrates impressive mAP scores, especially with larger variants like RTDETRv2-x achieving a mAPval50-95 of 54.3. Inference speeds are also competitive, making it suitable for real-time applications when using hardware acceleration like NVIDIA T4 GPUs.
