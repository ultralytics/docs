# EfficientDet vs. YOLO11: A Detailed Technical Comparison

This page offers a detailed technical comparison between Google's EfficientDet and [Ultralytics YOLO11](https://docs.ultralytics.com/models/yolo11/), two prominent [object detection](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/object-detection) models. We analyze their architectures, performance benchmarks, and suitability for different applications to assist you in selecting the optimal model for your [computer vision](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/computer-vision-cv) needs. While both models aim for efficient and accurate object detection, they stem from different research lines ([Google](https://ai.google/) and [Ultralytics](https://www.ultralytics.com/)) and employ distinct architectural philosophies.

## EfficientDet

EfficientDet is a family of object detection models developed by researchers at Google Brain. Introduced in 2019, it set a new standard for efficiency by combining a powerful backbone with a novel feature fusion mechanism and a unique scaling method.

**Technical Details:**

- **Authors:** Mingxing Tan, Ruoming Pang, and Quoc V. Le
- **Organization:** [Google](https://ai.google/)
- **Date:** 2019-11-20
- **Arxiv:** <https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.09070>
- **GitHub:** <https://github.com/google/automl/tree/master/efficientdet>
- **Docs:** <https://github.com/google/automl/tree/master/efficientdet#readme>

### Architecture and Key Features

EfficientDet's architecture is built on three core components:

1.  **EfficientNet Backbone:** It uses the highly efficient [EfficientNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.11946) as its [backbone](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/backbone) for feature extraction.
2.  **BiFPN (Bi-directional Feature Pyramid Network):** A novel, weighted feature pyramid network that allows for simple and fast multi-scale feature fusion. It introduces learnable weights to understand the importance of different input features and applies both top-down and bottom-up connections.
3.  **Compound Scaling:** A key innovation where the model depth, width, and resolution are scaled up together using a single compound coefficient. This allows the model family (from D0 to D7) to scale efficiently across a wide range of resource constraints.

### Strengths

- **High Efficiency:** EfficientDet models are renowned for their low parameter and [FLOPs](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/flops) counts, achieving strong accuracy for their computational budget.
- **Scalability:** The compound scaling method provides a clear path to scale the model up or down, making it adaptable to various hardware profiles, from mobile devices to data centers.
- **Strong Academic Benchmark:** It was a state-of-the-art model upon release and remains a strong baseline for efficiency-focused research.

### Weaknesses

- **Slower GPU Inference:** Despite its FLOP efficiency, EfficientDet can be slower in terms of real-world [inference latency](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/inference-latency) on GPUs compared to models like YOLO11, which are specifically designed for parallel processing hardware.
- **Limited Versatility:** EfficientDet is primarily an object detector. It lacks the native support for other tasks like [instance segmentation](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/instance-segmentation), [pose estimation](https://www.ultralytics.com/blog/what-is-pose-estimation-and-where-can-it-be-used), or classification that is integrated into modern frameworks like Ultralytics.
- **Less Maintained Ecosystem:** The official repository is not as actively developed as the Ultralytics ecosystem. This can lead to challenges in usability, community support, and integration with the latest tools and deployment platforms.

- **GitHub:** <https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics>
- **Docs:** <https://docs.ultralytics.com/models/yolo11/>

### Architecture and Key Features

YOLO11 employs a single-stage, [anchor-free detector](https://www.ultralytics.com/blog/benefits-ultralytics-yolo11-being-anchor-free-detector) architecture optimized for speed and precision. Its design features refined feature extraction layers and a streamlined network structure, which reduces parameter count and computational load without sacrificing accuracy. This ensures exceptional performance across diverse hardware, from [edge devices](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/edge-ai) like the [NVIDIA Jetson](https://docs.ultralytics.com/guides/nvidia-jetson/) to powerful cloud servers.

A significant advantage of YOLO11 is its integration within the comprehensive Ultralytics ecosystem. This provides developers with:

- **Ease of Use:** A simple and intuitive [Python API](https://docs.ultralytics.com/usage/python/) and [CLI](https://docs.ultralytics.com/usage/cli/) make training, validation, and inference straightforward.
- **Versatility:** YOLO11 is a multi-task model supporting [object detection](https://docs.ultralytics.com/tasks/detect/), [instance segmentation](https://docs.ultralytics.com/tasks/segment/), [image classification](https://docs.ultralytics.com/tasks/classify/), [pose estimation](https://docs.ultralytics.com/tasks/pose/), and oriented bounding boxes (OBB) within a single unified framework.
- **Well-Maintained Ecosystem:** The model benefits from active development, a large and supportive open-source community, frequent updates, and seamless integration with tools like [Ultralytics HUB](https://www.ultralytics.com/hub) for end-to-end MLOps.
- **Training and Memory Efficiency:** YOLO11 is designed for efficient training, often requiring less CUDA memory and converging faster than alternatives. It comes with readily available pre-trained weights on datasets like [COCO](https://docs.ultralytics.com/datasets/detect/coco/).

### Strengths

- **State-of-the-Art Performance:** Achieves an excellent balance of high [mAP](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/mean-average-precision-map) scores and fast inference speeds, especially on GPUs.
- **Deployment Flexibility:** Optimized for a wide range of hardware, with easy export to formats like [ONNX](https://docs.ultralytics.com/integrations/onnx/) and [TensorRT](https://docs.ultralytics.com/integrations/tensorrt/) for maximum performance.
- **User-Friendly Framework:** Backed by extensive [documentation](https://docs.ultralytics.com/), tutorials, and a strong community, lowering the barrier to entry for both beginners and experts.
- **Multi-Task Support:** A single YOLO11 model can be trained for various vision tasks, reducing development complexity and time.

### Weaknesses

- **CPU Performance Trade-offs:** While highly optimized for GPUs, the larger YOLO11 models can be slower on CPU-only environments compared to the smallest EfficientDet variants.
- **Small Object Detection:** Like other one-stage detectors, it can sometimes be challenged by detecting extremely small or heavily occluded objects in dense scenes, though continuous improvements are made with each version.

## Performance and Benchmarks

The performance comparison on the [COCO val2017 dataset](https://cocodataset.org/) highlights the different design philosophies of EfficientDet and YOLO11. EfficientDet excels in theoretical efficiency (mAP per parameter/FLOP), especially with its smaller models. However, when it comes to practical deployment, particularly on GPUs, YOLO11 demonstrates a clear advantage in inference speed.

For example, YOLO11s achieves a comparable mAP (47.0) to EfficientDet-d3 (47.5) but with a staggering **2.9x** faster inference speed on a T4 GPU. The largest model, YOLO11x, surpasses all EfficientDet models in accuracy (54.7 mAP) while remaining significantly faster on GPU than even mid-sized EfficientDet models. This makes YOLO11 the superior choice for applications where [real-time inference](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/real-time-inference) is critical.
