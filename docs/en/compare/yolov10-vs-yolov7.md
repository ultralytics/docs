## YOLOv10

YOLOv10, introduced in May 2024 by researchers from [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/), represents a significant advancement in [real-time object detection](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/real-time-inference). Its primary innovation is achieving end-to-end object detection by eliminating the need for [Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS)](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/non-maximum-suppression-nms) during inference. This breakthrough reduces computational overhead and lowers [inference latency](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/inference-latency), making deployment more efficient.

## Performance Comparison: YOLOv10 vs YOLOv7

When comparing performance, YOLOv10 demonstrates a clear advantage in efficiency. The most direct comparison is between YOLOv10-M and YOLOv7-L. As shown in the table below, YOLOv10-M achieves a nearly identical mAP<sup>val</sup> of 51.3% compared to YOLOv7-L's 51.4%. However, YOLOv10-M is significantly more efficient: it is faster (5.48ms vs. 6.84ms on TensorRT), has less than half the parameters (15.4M vs. 36.9M), and requires far fewer computational resources (59.1B FLOPs vs. 104.7B FLOPs). This highlights YOLOv10's superior architectural design, which delivers comparable accuracy with much greater efficiency.

## Conclusion

Both YOLOv10 and YOLOv7 are powerful object detection models, but YOLOv10 represents the next step in real-time detection efficiency. Its NMS-free architecture provides a true end-to-end solution that is faster, lighter, and easier to deploy without sacrificing accuracy. For new projects, especially those targeting [edge AI](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/edge-ai) or requiring minimal latency, YOLOv10 is the recommended choice.

While YOLOv7 is still a capable model, its reliance on NMS and less efficient architecture make it a better fit for legacy projects or scenarios where its extensive community resources are a primary consideration. For developers seeking the best performance, ease of use, and a comprehensive ecosystem, Ultralytics models like YOLOv10 offer a superior experience. The integration with [Ultralytics HUB](https://docs.ultralytics.com/hub/) further simplifies training and deployment, making advanced [computer vision](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/computer-vision-cv) more accessible than ever.
