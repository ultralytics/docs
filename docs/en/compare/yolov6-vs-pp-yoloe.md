## PP-YOLOE+

PP-YOLOE+ (Probabilistic and Point-wise YOLOv3 Enhancement) is developed by PaddlePaddle, Baidu, and was released in 2022. It's an evolution of the YOLO series, focusing on enhancing efficiency and accuracy without relying on complex distillation methods during inference. PP-YOLOE+ adopts an anchor-free detection approach, simplifying the architecture and training process. It uses a CSPRepResNet backbone, a PAFPN neck, and a Dynamic Head. This design aims for high performance while minimizing computational overhead.

PP-YOLOE+ is available in various sizes (tiny, small, medium, large, extra-large), allowing for flexible deployment based on computational resources. It excels in scenarios prioritizing high accuracy in object detection tasks, such as detailed image analysis and security systems. However, its inference speed might be slower compared to models optimized for speed.
