# YOLOv5 vs YOLO11: A Technical Comparison

Choosing the right object detection model is a critical decision that balances the need for accuracy, speed, and resource efficiency. This page provides a detailed technical comparison between two landmark models from Ultralytics: the widely adopted [Ultralytics YOLOv5](https://docs.ultralytics.com/models/yolov5/) and the state-of-the-art [Ultralytics YOLO11](https://docs.ultralytics.com/models/yolo11/). While YOLOv5 set an industry standard for performance and ease of use, YOLO11 represents the next evolution, offering superior accuracy, greater versatility, and enhanced efficiency within the same powerful Ultralytics ecosystem.

### Weaknesses

- **Anchor-Based Detection:** Its reliance on predefined anchor boxes can sometimes require careful tuning for datasets with unusually shaped objects, a limitation addressed by newer [anchor-free detectors](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/anchor-free-detectors).
- **Accuracy Ceiling:** While still very accurate, its performance on benchmarks like [COCO](https://docs.ultralytics.com/datasets/detect/coco/) has been surpassed by more recent architectures like YOLO11.

### Ideal Use Cases

YOLOv5 remains an excellent choice for applications where speed and stability are paramount:

- **Edge Computing:** Its smaller variants are perfect for deployment on resource-constrained devices like [Raspberry Pi](https://docs.ultralytics.com/guides/raspberry-pi/) and [NVIDIA Jetson](https://docs.ultralytics.com/guides/nvidia-jetson/).
- **Real-Time Surveillance:** Powering [security systems](https://www.ultralytics.com/blog/security-alarm-system-projects-with-ultralytics-yolov8) and monitoring applications that require high FPS.
- **Industrial Automation:** Used for quality control and process automation in [manufacturing](https://www.ultralytics.com/solutions/ai-in-manufacturing) environments.

- **Organization:** [Ultralytics](https://www.ultralytics.com/)
- **Date:** 2024-09-27
- **GitHub:** <https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics>
- **Docs:** <https://docs.ultralytics.com/models/yolo11/>

### Architecture and Key Features

YOLO11 introduces a refined network architecture with advanced feature extraction capabilities and a streamlined design. A major advancement is its anchor-free detection head, which improves generalization and simplifies the training process. This modern design allows YOLO11 to achieve higher accuracy with a more efficient use of parameters, leading to faster inference speeds and lower computational demands.

### Strengths

- **State-of-the-Art Performance:** YOLO11 sets a new standard for accuracy, achieving higher [mAP](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/mean-average-precision-map) scores than YOLOv5 across all model sizes.
- **Enhanced Versatility:** YOLO11 is a true multi-tasking framework, supporting [object detection](https://docs.ultralytics.com/tasks/detect/), [instance segmentation](https://docs.ultralytics.com/tasks/segment/), [image classification](https://docs.ultralytics.com/tasks/classify/), [pose estimation](https://docs.ultralytics.com/tasks/pose/), and oriented bounding boxes (OBB) within a single, unified model.
- **Superior Efficiency:** The model is highly efficient, offering a better speed-accuracy trade-off. Notably, it demonstrates significantly faster inference on CPUs compared to YOLOv5, making it accessible for a wider range of hardware. It also requires less memory for training and inference than many other architectures.
