## DAMO-YOLO: A Fast and Accurate Method from Alibaba

**Authors:** Xianzhe Xu, Yiqi Jiang, Weihua Chen, Yilun Huang, Yuan Zhang, and Xiuyu Sun  
**Organization:** [Alibaba Group](https://www.alibabagroup.com/en-US/)  
**Date:** 2022-11-23  
**Arxiv:** <https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.15444>  
**GitHub:** <https://github.com/tinyvision/DAMO-YOLO>

DAMO-YOLO is an object detection model developed by Alibaba that focuses on achieving a superior balance between speed and accuracy. It introduces several novel techniques to enhance performance across a wide range of hardware, from edge devices to cloud GPUs. The architecture is a result of a "once-for-all" methodology, where a supernet is trained and then specialized sub-networks are derived using [Neural Architecture Search (NAS)](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/neural-architecture-search-nas) to fit different computational constraints.

### Architecture and Key Features

DAMO-YOLO's architecture incorporates several key innovations:

- **NAS-Generated Backbones:** Instead of a manually designed backbone, DAMO-YOLO uses backbones discovered through NAS, which are optimized for feature extraction efficiency.
- **Efficient RepGFPN Neck:** It employs a new feature pyramid network neck, RepGFPN, which is designed for efficient feature fusion and is compatible with re-parameterization techniques to boost speed during inference.
- **ZeroHead:** A simplified, lightweight detection head that reduces computational overhead while maintaining high performance.
- **AlignedOTA Label Assignment:** An improved label assignment strategy that addresses misalignment issues between classification and regression tasks, leading to more accurate predictions.
- **Distillation Enhancement:** Knowledge distillation is used to transfer knowledge from a larger teacher model to a smaller student model, further improving the accuracy of the compact models.

### Strengths

- **High GPU Speed:** DAMO-YOLO is highly optimized for fast inference on GPUs, making it suitable for real-time video processing and other latency-sensitive applications.
- **Scalable Models:** It offers a family of models (Tiny, Small, Medium, Large) that provide a clear trade-off between speed and accuracy, allowing developers to choose the best fit for their hardware.
- **Innovative Techniques:** The use of NAS, an efficient neck, and an advanced label assigner demonstrates a modern approach to detector design.

### Weaknesses

- **Task Specificity:** DAMO-YOLO is primarily designed for [object detection](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/object-detection) and lacks the built-in versatility for other tasks like [instance segmentation](https://docs.ultralytics.com/tasks/segment/) or [pose estimation](https://docs.ultralytics.com/tasks/pose/) found in comprehensive frameworks like Ultralytics.
- **Ecosystem and Usability:** While powerful, its ecosystem is less mature than that of Ultralytics. Users may find it requires more effort for training, deployment, and integration into production pipelines.
- **Community Support:** The community and available resources might be smaller compared to more widely adopted models like those from the YOLO series.

**Organization:** [Institute of Information Science, Academia Sinica, Taiwan](https://www.iis.sinica.edu.tw/en/index.html)  
**Date:** 2024-02-21  
**Arxiv:** <https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13616>  
**GitHub:** <https://github.com/WongKinYiu/yolov9>  
**Documentation:** <https://docs.ultralytics.com/models/yolov9/>

[YOLOv9](https://docs.ultralytics.com/models/yolov9/) represents a significant leap forward in real-time object detection, introducing groundbreaking concepts to address information loss in deep neural networks. Its core innovations, Programmable Gradient Information (PGI) and the Generalized Efficient Layer Aggregation Network (GELAN), enable it to achieve superior accuracy and parameter efficiency. When integrated into the Ultralytics framework, YOLOv9 combines this state-of-the-art performance with an unparalleled user experience.

### Architecture and Key Features

YOLOv9's strength lies in its novel architectural components:

- **Programmable Gradient Information (PGI):** This mechanism helps mitigate the information bottleneck problem by generating reliable gradients through an auxiliary reversible branch, ensuring that deeper layers receive complete input information for accurate updates.
- **Generalized Efficient Layer Aggregation Network (GELAN):** An advanced network architecture that builds upon the principles of CSPNet and ELAN. GELAN is designed for optimal parameter utilization and computational efficiency, making it both powerful and fast.

### Strengths

- **State-of-the-Art Accuracy:** YOLOv9 sets a new standard for accuracy on the [COCO dataset](https://docs.ultralytics.com/datasets/detect/coco/), outperforming many previous models at similar or lower computational costs.
- **Superior Efficiency:** As shown in the performance table, YOLOv9 models often achieve higher accuracy with fewer parameters and FLOPs compared to competitors, making them ideal for deployment on a range of hardware from [edge devices](https://www.ultralytics.com/blog/edge-ai-and-aiot-upgrade-any-camera-with-ultralytics-yolov8-in-a-no-code-way) to powerful servers.
- **Well-Maintained Ecosystem:** Integrated into the Ultralytics ecosystem, YOLOv9 benefits from **ease of use** via a streamlined [Python API](https://docs.ultralytics.com/usage/python/) and [CLI](https://docs.ultralytics.com/usage/cli/), extensive [documentation](https://docs.ultralytics.com/models/yolov9/), and active community support.
- **Training Efficiency:** The Ultralytics implementation ensures **efficient training processes** with readily available pre-trained weights, lower memory requirements, and seamless integration with tools like [Ultralytics HUB](https://www.ultralytics.com/hub) for no-code training and MLOps.
- **Versatility:** While the original paper focuses on detection, the GELAN architecture is highly adaptable. The Ultralytics ecosystem extends its capabilities to other vision tasks, aligning with the multi-task support found in models like [YOLOv8](https://docs.ultralytics.com/models/yolov8/).

### Weaknesses

- **Newer Model:** As a more recent architecture, the number of community-contributed tutorials and third-party integrations is still growing, though its inclusion in the Ultralytics library has significantly accelerated its adoption.
- **Resource Requirements:** The largest YOLOv9 variants, like YOLOv9-E, require substantial computational resources for training, although they provide top-tier accuracy for their size.

From the table, we can draw several conclusions:

- **Accuracy:** YOLOv9 models consistently achieve higher mAP scores. For instance, YOLOv9m surpasses DAMO-YOLOl with a 51.4 mAP versus 50.8 mAP. The largest model, YOLOv9-E, reaches an impressive 55.6 mAP, setting a new benchmark.
- **Efficiency:** YOLOv9 demonstrates remarkable parameter and computational efficiency. YOLOv9m delivers better accuracy than DAMO-YOLOl while using less than half the parameters (20.0M vs. 42.1M) and fewer FLOPs (76.3B vs. 97.3B). This makes YOLOv9 a more efficient choice for achieving high performance.
- **Inference Speed:** On a T4 GPU, inference speeds are competitive. For example, DAMO-YOLOs (3.45 ms) and YOLOv9s (3.54 ms) are very close in speed, but YOLOv9s achieves a higher mAP (46.8 vs. 46.0).

## Conclusion: Which Model Should You Choose?

Both DAMO-YOLO and YOLOv9 are excellent object detectors with unique strengths. DAMO-YOLO offers a fast and scalable solution with innovative techniques like NAS and an efficient RepGFPN neck, making it a solid choice for applications requiring high-speed GPU inference.

However, for most developers and researchers, **YOLOv9 is the recommended choice, especially when used within the Ultralytics ecosystem.** It not only delivers state-of-the-art accuracy and superior efficiency but also provides significant advantages in usability and support. The Ultralytics framework abstracts away complexity, offering a streamlined workflow from training to deployment. The combination of PGI and GELAN in YOLOv9 provides a more advanced and efficient architecture, while the robust Ultralytics ecosystem ensures you have the tools, documentation, and community support needed to succeed.
