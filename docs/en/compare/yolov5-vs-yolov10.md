## YOLOv10: The Cutting Edge of Real-Time Detection

YOLOv10, developed by Ao Wang, Hui Chen, Lihao Liu, et al. from Tsinghua University and introduced on 2024-05-23, represents the newest advancements in the YOLO series. It focuses on end-to-end efficiency and enhanced accuracy, aiming to overcome limitations of previous models.

### Architecture and Features

YOLOv10 introduces innovations in network architecture and training methodologies to achieve state-of-the-art real-time object detection. Key features include consistent dual assignments for NMS-free training, which reduces inference latency, and a holistic efficiency-accuracy driven model design strategy. This results in a model that is both faster and more accurate compared to its predecessors. For more architectural details, refer to the [YOLOv10 arXiv paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14458) and the [official GitHub repository](https://github.com/THU-MIG/yolov10).

### Performance Metrics

YOLOv10 demonstrates superior performance in both speed and accuracy. For example, YOLOv10-S achieves a mAPval50-95 of 46.3% with a latency of 2.49ms. The models are available in various sizes, from YOLOv10-N to YOLOv10-X, catering to different computational needs. Detailed performance metrics are available in the [model documentation](https://docs.ultralytics.com/models/yolov10/).
