**RTDETRv2** (Real-Time Detection Transformer version 2) is an advanced object detection model leveraging Vision Transformers (ViT) to achieve a strong balance between high accuracy and real-time performance. It represents a shift from traditional CNN-based approaches by utilizing transformer architectures.

### Architecture and Key Features

RTDETRv2 employs a **transformer-based architecture**, specifically using a [Vision Transformer (ViT)](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/vision-transformer-vit) backbone combined with efficient CNN stages for feature extraction. This allows the model to capture **global context** within images effectively through [self-attention mechanisms](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/self-attention), leading to improved accuracy, particularly in complex scenes with intricate object relationships. Like YOLOX, it is designed as an **anchor-free detector**, simplifying the detection pipeline.

### Performance Metrics

RTDETRv2 models prioritize accuracy while maintaining competitive speeds, especially with hardware acceleration. As shown in the table below, the larger **RTDETRv2-x** variant achieves a high **54.3% mAP<sup>val</sup>50-95** on COCO. Its inference speed on an NVIDIA T4 GPU with [TensorRT](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/tensorrt) is respectable, with **RTDETRv2-s** running at **5.03ms**. However, transformer models like RTDETRv2 typically require significantly more CUDA memory during training compared to CNN-based models like YOLOX or Ultralytics YOLO models.
