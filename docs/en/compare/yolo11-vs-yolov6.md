## Ultralytics YOLO11

Ultralytics YOLO11 is the latest cutting-edge model in the YOLO series, authored by Glenn Jocher and Jing Qiu from Ultralytics, released on 2024-09-27. It builds upon previous versions to deliver state-of-the-art object detection capabilities, engineered for enhanced accuracy and efficiency across various computer vision tasks including object detection, instance segmentation, image classification, and pose estimation.

YOLO11 introduces architectural improvements for more precise predictions and greater efficiency. Notably, YOLO11m achieves a higher mean Average Precision (mAP) on the COCO dataset with fewer parameters compared to YOLOv8m. This efficiency extends to diverse platforms, from edge devices to cloud systems. The optimized design leads to faster processing speeds and reduced computational costs, making it suitable for real-time applications and resource-constrained environments. For more details, refer to the official YOLO11 documentation.
