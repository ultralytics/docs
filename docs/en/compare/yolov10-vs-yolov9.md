## YOLOv10: Real-Time End-to-End Efficiency

[YOLOv10](https://docs.ultralytics.com/models/yolov10/) is a cutting-edge model from researchers at Tsinghua University, released in May 2024. It is engineered to deliver exceptional real-time performance by creating a truly end-to-end object detection pipeline. The standout innovation is its elimination of [Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS)](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/non-maximum-suppression-nms), a post-processing step that traditionally adds [inference latency](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/inference-latency). This makes YOLOv10 a highly efficient choice for applications where speed is critical.
