## Ultralytics YOLO11

[Ultralytics YOLO11](https://docs.ultralytics.com/models/yolo11/) is the latest iteration in the YOLO (You Only Look Once) series, renowned for its real-time object detection capabilities. YOLO11 builds upon the advancements of previous versions, offering enhanced accuracy and efficiency.

### Architecture and Key Features

YOLO11 maintains a single-stage detector architecture, optimizing for speed by performing object detection in one pass. Key architectural improvements in YOLO11 include enhanced feature extraction and a refined network structure that reduces parameter count while increasing accuracy. This model is designed for versatility, supporting tasks beyond object detection such as instance segmentation, image classification, and pose estimation. For a deeper dive into the architectural improvements, refer to the [Ultralytics YOLO11 announcement blog post](https://www.ultralytics.com/blog/ultralytics-yolo11-has-arrived-redefine-whats-possible-in-ai).

### Performance Metrics

YOLO11 demonstrates a strong balance of speed and accuracy. As indicated in the comparison table below, YOLO11 models achieve high mAP scores while maintaining fast inference times. For instance, YOLO11m attains a 51.5 mAP<sup>val</sup> 50-95. The efficiency of YOLO11 is further highlighted by its reduced parameter count compared to previous YOLO versions while achieving superior performance.

## EfficientDet

EfficientDet, developed by Google, focuses on creating highly efficient object detection models by systematically scaling network width, depth, and resolution.

### Architecture and Key Features

EfficientDet utilizes a bi-directional feature pyramid network (BiFPN) and compound scaling to optimize both accuracy and efficiency. The BiFPN enables efficient multi-scale feature fusion, while compound scaling ensures a balanced scaling of network dimensions to maximize performance gains without excessive computational cost.

As shown in the table, EfficientDet-D4 achieves a mAP<sup>val</sup> 50-95 of 49.7, with varying speeds depending on the specific variant. EfficientDet's strength lies in its ability to provide competitive accuracy with fewer parameters and FLOPs compared to some larger models.

### Use Cases and Strengths

EfficientDet is particularly effective in scenarios where computational resources are limited, such as mobile devices and edge computing environments. Its efficiency makes it suitable for applications like [mobile object detection](https://docs.ultralytics.com/hub/app/android/) and embedded systems. EfficientDet's strengths include:

- **High Efficiency:** Designed for resource-constrained environments.
