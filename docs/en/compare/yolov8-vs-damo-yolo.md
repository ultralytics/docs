**Organization:** Ultralytics  
**Date:** 2023-01-10  
**GitHub:** [https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics)  
**Docs:** [https://docs.ultralytics.com/models/yolov8/](https://docs.ultralytics.com/models/yolov8/)

[Ultralytics YOLOv8](https://docs.ultralytics.com/models/yolov8/) is the latest iteration in the renowned YOLO series, known for achieving an excellent balance between speed and accuracy. Developed by [Ultralytics](https://www.ultralytics.com/), YOLOv8 builds upon previous versions with architectural improvements and a strong focus on user-friendliness and versatility across multiple vision tasks.

### Architecture and Key Features

YOLOv8 features a refined architecture based on previous YOLO models, incorporating an anchor-free detection head and an optimized backbone (CSPDarknet variant). This design simplifies the model and improves efficiency. A key advantage of YOLOv8 is its versatility; it's designed as a unified framework supporting [object detection](https://docs.ultralytics.com/tasks/detect/), [instance segmentation](https://docs.ultralytics.com/tasks/segment/), [pose estimation](https://docs.ultralytics.com/tasks/pose/), [image classification](https://docs.ultralytics.com/tasks/classify/), and [oriented bounding boxes (OBB)](https://docs.ultralytics.com/tasks/obb/).

### Strengths

- **Ease of Use:** YOLOv8 offers a streamlined user experience with a simple [Python API](https://docs.ultralytics.com/usage/python/) and [CLI](https://docs.ultralytics.com/usage/cli/), extensive [documentation](https://docs.ultralytics.com/guides/), and readily available pre-trained weights, significantly reducing development time.
- **Performance Balance:** It delivers state-of-the-art mean Average Precision (mAP) while maintaining high inference speeds, suitable for diverse real-world applications from edge devices to cloud servers. See the [YOLO performance metrics guide](https://docs.ultralytics.com/guides/yolo-performance-metrics/) for more details.
- **Versatility:** Supports multiple computer vision tasks within a single, consistent framework, unlike many competitors focused solely on object detection.
- **Well-Maintained Ecosystem:** Benefits from active development by Ultralytics, frequent updates, strong community support, and integration with [Ultralytics HUB](https://www.ultralytics.com/hub) for seamless training, visualization, and deployment.
- **Training Efficiency:** Efficient training processes and lower memory requirements compared to many other models, especially transformer-based architectures like [RT-DETR](https://docs.ultralytics.com/models/rtdetr/).

### Weaknesses

- **Resource Intensive:** Larger YOLOv8 models (L/X) require substantial computational resources for training and inference, similar to other high-performance models.
- **Optimization Needs:** For deployment on extremely resource-constrained devices, further optimization like [model pruning](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/pruning) or [quantization](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/model-quantization) might be necessary.

### Use Cases

YOLOv8's blend of speed, accuracy, and versatility makes it ideal for:

- Real-time video analytics in [security systems](https://www.ultralytics.com/blog/security-alarm-system-projects-with-ultralytics-yolov8) and [smart cities](https://www.ultralytics.com/blog/computer-vision-ai-in-smart-cities).
- Complex tasks in [healthcare](https://www.ultralytics.com/solutions/ai-in-healthcare) and [manufacturing](https://www.ultralytics.com/solutions/ai-in-manufacturing).
- Applications requiring multiple vision capabilities (e.g., detecting objects and estimating their pose simultaneously).
- Rapid prototyping and development due to its ease of use and comprehensive ecosystem.

YOLOv8 models demonstrate superior speed, especially the smaller variants (n/s) on both CPU and GPU (TensorRT), making them ideal for real-time applications. YOLOv8n achieves impressive speed with minimal parameters and FLOPs. While DAMO-YOLO models show competitive mAP, YOLOv8 often provides a better speed/accuracy trade-off across different model sizes and reports clear CPU inference times, which are crucial for many deployment scenarios. YOLOv8x achieves the highest mAP in this comparison.
