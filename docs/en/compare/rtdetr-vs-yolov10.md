### Architecture and Features

RTDETRv2's architecture leverages the strengths of Vision Transformers ([ViT](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/vision-transformer-vit)), enabling it to capture global context within images through self-attention mechanisms. This transformer-based approach allows the model to weigh the importance of different image regions, leading to enhanced feature extraction and improved accuracy, particularly in complex scenes with overlapping objects or varied scales. Unlike traditional CNN-based models, RTDETRv2 excels in understanding the broader context of an image, contributing to its robust detection capabilities.

### Performance Analysis

RTDETRv2 models, particularly larger variants like RTDETRv2-x, achieve impressive mAP scores, reaching up to 54.3 mAP<sup>val</sup>50-95. Inference speeds are competitive, especially when using hardware acceleration like [NVIDIA TensorRT](https://docs.ultralytics.com/integrations/tensorrt/), making RTDETRv2 suitable for real-time applications on capable hardware. However, transformer models like RTDETRv2 typically require significantly more CUDA memory during training compared to CNN-based models like YOLOv10.
