## RTDETRv2: Transformer-Based High-Accuracy Detection

**RTDETRv2** ([Real-Time Detection Transformer v2](https://docs.ultralytics.com/models/rtdetr/)) is designed for high accuracy in real-time object detection tasks. Developed by Baidu and detailed in their [2024 paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17140), RTDETRv2 leverages a Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture to achieve state-of-the-art performance.

### Architecture and Features

RTDETRv2's architecture is based on Vision Transformers, which excel at capturing global context within images through self-attention mechanisms. This approach allows RTDETRv2 to understand complex scenes and improve detection accuracy, especially in scenarios with overlapping objects or varied scales. Unlike traditional CNN-based models, RTDETRv2's transformer backbone enables robust feature extraction, leading to enhanced detection capabilities. The [RT-DETR GitHub repository](https://github.com/lyuwenyu/RT-DETR/tree/main/rtdetrv2_pytorch) provides further architectural details.

### Performance Analysis

RTDETRv2 models, particularly larger variants like RTDETRv2-x, achieve impressive mAP scores, reaching up to 54.3 mAP<sup>val</sup><sub>50-95</sub>. Inference speeds are also competitive, making RTDETRv2 suitable for real-time applications when using capable hardware such as NVIDIA T4 GPUs. Refer to the [model comparison table](https://docs.ultralytics.com/models/) for detailed metrics.
