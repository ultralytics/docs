## Ultralytics YOLO10

Ultralytics YOLO10 represents the cutting-edge in real-time end-to-end object detection, crafted by Ao Wang, Hui Chen, Lihao Liu, and team from Tsinghua University, as detailed in their paper released on Arxiv in May 2024. YOLO10 is engineered for superior efficiency and accuracy, streamlining deployment by eliminating Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS) post-processing. Its architecture is holistically optimized for both speed and precision, achieving state-of-the-art performance across various model scales.

YOLO10 introduces innovations like Consistent Dual Assignments for NMS-free training and comprehensive efficiency-accuracy driven model design. This results in reduced computational redundancy and enhanced model capabilities. For example, YOLOv10-S demonstrates 1.8x faster inference than RT-DETR-R18 with comparable Average Precision (AP) on the COCO dataset, while being significantly smaller in parameters and FLOPs.
