## Ultralytics YOLO11

Ultralytics YOLO11, authored by Glenn Jocher and Jing Qiu from Ultralytics and released on 2024-09-27, is the latest evolution in the YOLO series. It focuses on enhancing both accuracy and efficiency in object detection, making it versatile for a wide array of real-world applications. [Ultralytics YOLO11](https://docs.ultralytics.com/models/yolo11/) builds upon previous YOLO models, refining the network structure to achieve state-of-the-art detection precision while maintaining real-time performance.

**Architecture and Key Features:**

YOLO11's architecture incorporates advanced feature extraction techniques, resulting in higher accuracy with a reduced parameter count compared to models like YOLOv8. This optimization leads to faster [inference engine](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/inference-engine) speeds and lower computational demands, making it suitable for deployment across diverse platforms, from edge devices to cloud infrastructure. YOLO11 supports multiple computer vision tasks, including [object detection](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/object-detection), [instance segmentation](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/instance-segmentation), [image classification](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/image-classification), and [pose estimation](https://docs.ultralytics.com/tasks/pose/).
