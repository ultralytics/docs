## Ultralytics YOLO11

**Authors:** Glenn Jocher, Jing Qiu  
**Organization:** [Ultralytics](https://www.ultralytics.com/)  
**Date:** 2024-09-27  
**GitHub:** [https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics)  
**Docs:** [https://docs.ultralytics.com/models/yolo11/](https://docs.ultralytics.com/models/yolo11/)

Ultralytics YOLO11 is the latest advancement in the renowned YOLO (You Only Look Once) series, celebrated for its rapid and effective object detection capabilities. YOLO11 enhances prior YOLO iterations with architectural refinements aimed at boosting both precision and speed. It retains the one-stage detection method, processing images in a single pass for [real-time performance](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/real-time-inference).

A key advantage of YOLO11 is its **versatility**. Unlike DAMO-YOLO, which primarily focuses on detection, YOLO11 is a multi-task framework supporting [object detection](https://docs.ultralytics.com/tasks/detect/), [instance segmentation](https://docs.ultralytics.com/tasks/segment/), [image classification](https://docs.ultralytics.com/tasks/classify/), and [pose estimation](https://docs.ultralytics.com/tasks/pose/). This makes it a comprehensive solution for complex computer vision pipelines.

### Architecture and Key Features

YOLO11 focuses on balancing model size and accuracy through architectural improvements. These include refined feature extraction layers for richer feature capture and a streamlined network to cut computational costs, leading to faster and more parameter-efficient models. Its adaptable design allows deployment on a wide range of hardware, from [edge devices](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/edge-ai) like the [NVIDIA Jetson](https://docs.ultralytics.com/guides/nvidia-jetson/) to powerful cloud servers.

Crucially, YOLO11 benefits immensely from the **well-maintained Ultralytics ecosystem**. This provides a significant advantage for developers and researchers:

- **Ease of Use:** A simple [Python API](https://docs.ultralytics.com/usage/python/), clear [CLI](https://docs.ultralytics.com/usage/cli/), and extensive [documentation](https://docs.ultralytics.com/) make getting started straightforward.
- **Integrated Workflow:** Seamless integration with [Ultralytics HUB](https://www.ultralytics.com/hub) simplifies dataset management, training, and deployment, streamlining the entire [MLOps](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/machine-learning-operations-mlops) lifecycle.
- **Training Efficiency:** Efficient training processes, readily available pre-trained weights on datasets like [COCO](https://docs.ultralytics.com/datasets/detect/coco/), and typically lower memory requirements compared to other complex architectures.
- **Active Development:** Frequent updates, strong community support via [GitHub](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics/issues) and Discord, and numerous [integrations](https://docs.ultralytics.com/integrations/) with tools like [TensorRT](https://docs.ultralytics.com/integrations/tensorrt/) and [OpenVINO](https://docs.ultralytics.com/integrations/openvino/).

## DAMO-YOLO

**Authors:** Xianzhe Xu, Yiqi Jiang, Weihua Chen, Yilun Huang, Yuan Zhang, and Xiuyu Sun  
**Organization:** [Alibaba Group](https://www.alibabagroup.com/en-US/)  
**Date:** 2022-11-23  
**Arxiv:** [https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.15444v2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.15444v2)  
**GitHub:** [https://github.com/tinyvision/DAMO-YOLO](https://github.com/tinyvision/DAMO-YOLO)  
**Docs:** [https://github.com/tinyvision/DAMO-YOLO/blob/master/README.md](https://github.com/tinyvision/DAMO-YOLO/blob/master/README.md)

DAMO-YOLO is an object detection model developed by the Alibaba Group that introduces several novel techniques to achieve a strong balance between speed and accuracy. It is part of the YOLO family but incorporates unique architectural components derived from advanced research concepts.

### Architecture and Key Features

DAMO-YOLO's architecture is built on several key innovations:

- **MAE-NAS Backbone:** It uses a [Neural Architecture Search (NAS)](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/neural-architecture-search-nas) approach to find an optimal backbone structure, resulting in efficient feature extraction.
- **Efficient RepGFPN Neck:** It employs a generalized feature pyramid network with re-parameterization to enhance feature fusion across different scales effectively.
- **ZeroHead:** The model uses a lightweight, decoupled head that separates classification and regression tasks with minimal overhead.
- **AlignedOTA Label Assignment:** It introduces an improved label assignment strategy to better align classification and regression targets during training, which helps boost accuracy.

While these features make DAMO-YOLO a powerful detector, its primary focus remains on object detection. It lacks the built-in support for other vision tasks like segmentation or pose estimation that YOLO11 provides. Furthermore, its ecosystem is less comprehensive, with fewer official tutorials, integrations, and a smaller community compared to Ultralytics YOLO.

From the table, we can draw several conclusions:

- **Accuracy:** YOLO11 models consistently achieve higher [mAP](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/mean-average-precision-map) scores than their DAMO-YOLO counterparts. For instance, YOLO11m reaches 51.5 mAP, outperforming DAMO-YOLOm's 49.2 mAP. The largest model, YOLO11x, achieves a state-of-the-art 54.7 mAP.
- **Efficiency:** YOLO11 models are more parameter-efficient. YOLO11m achieves its superior accuracy with only 20.1M parameters, compared to 28.2M for DAMO-YOLOm.
- **Inference Speed:** YOLO11n is the fastest model on both CPU and GPU, making it ideal for highly constrained [edge computing](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/edge-computing) scenarios. Notably, Ultralytics provides transparent CPU benchmarks, a critical metric for many real-world applications that DAMO-YOLO's official results omit.
