## Ultralytics YOLO11: The New State-of-the-Art

YOLO11, authored by Glenn Jocher and Jing Qiu, is the latest and most advanced model in the Ultralytics YOLO series. Released in 2024, it builds upon the strong foundation of its predecessors like [YOLOv8](https://docs.ultralytics.com/models/yolov8/) to set a new benchmark in performance and efficiency. It is engineered not just for object detection but as a comprehensive framework for a multitude of computer vision tasks.

## YOLOv5: The Established and Versatile Workhorse

Released in 2020 by Glenn Jocher at Ultralytics, YOLOv5 quickly became one of the most popular object detection models in the world. It is celebrated for its exceptional balance of speed and accuracy, its ease of use, and its robust, well-documented implementation in [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/).

- **GitHub:** <https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5>
- **Docs:** <https://docs.ultralytics.com/models/yolov5/>

### Architecture and Key Features

YOLOv5 uses an architecture based on a CSPDarknet53 backbone and a PANet neck for effective feature aggregation. Its detection head is **anchor-based**, which was a standard and effective approach at the time of its release. One of YOLOv5's greatest strengths is its scalability, offering a range of models from the tiny 'n' (nano) version to the large 'x' (extra-large) version, allowing developers to easily trade between speed and accuracy.

### Strengths

- **Exceptional Inference Speed:** Highly optimized for real-time performance, making it a go-to choice for applications on [edge devices](https://www.ultralytics.com/blog/edge-ai-and-aiot-upgrade-any-camera-with-ultralytics-yolov8-in-a-no-code-way) like [NVIDIA Jetson](https://docs.ultralytics.com/guides/nvidia-jetson/).
- **Ease of Use:** Renowned for its simple API, extensive tutorials, and streamlined training and deployment workflows.
- **Mature Ecosystem:** Backed by a massive community, years of active development, and countless real-world deployments, ensuring stability and reliability.
- **Flexibility:** The wide range of model sizes makes it adaptable to nearly any hardware constraint.

### Weaknesses

- **Lower Accuracy:** While still powerful, its accuracy is surpassed by newer models like YOLO11.
- **Anchor-Based Detection:** Relies on predefined anchor boxes, which can sometimes require manual tuning for optimal performance on custom datasets compared to modern [anchor-free detectors](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/anchor-free-detectors).

### Ideal Use Cases

YOLOv5 remains an excellent choice for specific scenarios:

- **Edge Computing:** Deploying on resource-constrained devices like a [Raspberry Pi](https://docs.ultralytics.com/guides/raspberry-pi/) where inference speed is the top priority.
- **Rapid Prototyping:** Its simplicity and speed make it perfect for quickly building and testing proof-of-concept applications.
- **Legacy Systems:** Maintaining or updating existing projects built on the YOLOv5 framework.
- **Real-Time Surveillance:** Powering [security systems](https://www.ultralytics.com/blog/security-alarm-system-projects-with-ultralytics-yolov8) where high FPS is crucial.

## Performance and Benchmarks: YOLO11 vs. YOLOv5

The performance metrics clearly illustrate the evolution from YOLOv5 to YOLO11. On the [COCO dataset](https://docs.ultralytics.com/datasets/detect/coco/), YOLO11 models consistently achieve higher mAP scores than their YOLOv5 counterparts of similar size. For example, YOLO11m reaches 51.5 mAP, significantly outperforming YOLOv5m's 45.4 mAP. Furthermore, YOLO11 often does this with greater computational efficiency. Notably, the smallest model, YOLO11n, is faster on CPU than YOLOv5n while delivering a massive 11.5-point increase in mAP.
