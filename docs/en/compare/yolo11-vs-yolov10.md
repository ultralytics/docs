## Architectural Differences

**YOLO11**, the latest iteration in the YOLO series, builds upon the foundation of previous models like YOLOv8, focusing on enhanced feature extraction and improved parameter efficiency. A key architectural highlight of YOLO11 is its refined network structure, designed to capture more intricate details with fewer parameters. This is achieved through advancements in network layers and optimization techniques, leading to a model that is both accurate and computationally efficient. YOLO11 supports all the standard YOLO [computer vision tasks](https://docs.ultralytics.com/tasks/) including object detection, [instance segmentation](https://docs.ultralytics.com/tasks/segment/), [image classification](https://docs.ultralytics.com/tasks/classify/), and [pose estimation](https://docs.ultralytics.com/tasks/pose/).

**YOLOv10**, while also striving for high performance, emphasizes real-time efficiency and speed. It introduces innovations aimed at reducing inference latency, making it particularly suitable for applications requiring rapid object detection. One of the notable architectural changes in YOLOv10 is the elimination of Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS) in post-processing, streamlining the inference pipeline and contributing to faster processing times. This architectural choice directly addresses the need for speed in real-time applications. Like YOLO11, YOLOv10 is versatile and capable of handling various computer vision tasks.

## Performance Metrics

Looking at the performance metrics, both YOLO11 and YOLOv10 demonstrate strong object detection capabilities, but with trade-offs.

**Accuracy (mAP):** YOLO11 models generally achieve slightly higher mAP (mean Average Precision) scores, indicating superior accuracy in object detection, particularly in the larger model sizes like YOLO11x. For instance, YOLO11m achieves a mAP<sup>val</sup><sub>50-95</sub> of 51.5, slightly better than YOLOv10m's 51.3. This edge in accuracy makes YOLO11 preferable when precision is paramount. To understand more about mAP and other metrics, refer to the [YOLO Performance Metrics guide](https://docs.ultralytics.com/guides/yolo-performance-metrics/).

**Inference Speed:** YOLOv10 excels in inference speed, especially when measured with TensorRT on NVIDIA T4 GPUs. For example, YOLOv10n and YOLOv10s show slightly faster inference times (1.56ms and 2.66ms respectively) compared to YOLO11n and YOLO11s (1.5ms and 2.5ms). The removal of NMS in YOLOv10 directly contributes to this speed advantage, making it more suitable for real-time processing environments. For optimizing inference speed, consider exploring [OpenVINO Latency vs Throughput Modes](https://docs.ultralytics.com/guides/optimizing-openvino-latency-vs-throughput-modes/).

**Model Size and Parameters:** YOLO11 models are designed to be parameter-efficient. For example, YOLO11m has 20.1 million parameters, which is fewer than YOLOv10m's 15.4 million parameters. However, YOLOv10 generally has smaller model sizes across comparable variants. This difference in parameter count and model size can influence deployment decisions, especially on resource-constrained devices. Model size is an important factor in [model deployment options](https://docs.ultralytics.com/guides/model-deployment-options/).
