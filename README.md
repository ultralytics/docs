## Installation Guide üîß

Install the `ultralytics` package for your ML projects by following these steps, ensuring you have Git and Python 3 installed on your system:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Use Git to download the `ultralytics` repository onto your local machine.
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics.git
    ```

2. **Change Directory**: Navigate to the repository's root to access the package content.
    ```bash
    cd ultralytics
    ```

3. **Install in Developer Mode**: Use `pip` to install the package with developer privileges. This allows for real-time updates to the codebase in your environment.
    ```bash
    pip install -e '.[dev]'
    ```
    > üìù Note: If you have multiple Python versions, you may need to use `pip3`.

## Local Development Workflow üöÄ

### Building and Serving Docs Locally

If you're making documentation changes and want to preview them locally, employ the `mkdocs serve` command as follows:
```bash
mkdocs serve
```
- **Build and Preview Locally**: Watch your changes in real-time as you modify your documentation.

To stop the server, simply use the `CTRL+C` interrupt command in your terminal.

### Supporting Multiple Languages

For multi-language documentation, ensure you perform these additional steps:

1. **Commit New Translations**: Add all new translations in Markdown files to the git repository.
    ```bash
    git add docs/**/*.md -f
    ```
2. **Build Translations**: Manually build each language using the respective MkDocs configuration files.
    ```bash
    # Clear the existing /site directory
    rm -rf site

    # Build the primary language
    mkdocs build -f docs/mkdocs.yml

    # Build additional languages
    for file in docs/mkdocs_*.yml; do
      echo "Now building docs with: $file"
      mkdocs build -f "$file"
    done
    ```
3. **Preview the Multi-language Site**: Visually inspect the translations in your browser.
    ```bash
    cd site
    python -m http.server
    # MacOS users can open the site with:
    open http://localhost:8000
    ```

## Deployment üåê

To publish your MkDocs documentation site, identify a suitable host (e.g., GitHub Pages, GitLab Pages, or Amazon S3), and configure the `mkdocs.yml` with necessary deployment details.

Deploy using the command below (using GitHub Pages as an example):
```bash
mkdocs gh-deploy
```
For GitHub Pages, you can even establish a custom domain in your repository's "Settings."
