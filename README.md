To install the ultralytics package in developer mode, ensure you have Git and Python 3 installed on your system. Then, follow these steps:
To install the `ultralytics` package in developer mode, which allows you to modify the source code directly, ensure you have [Git](https://git-scm.com/) and [Python](https://www.python.org/) 3.9 or later installed on your system. Then, follow these steps:

1. Clone the ultralytics repository to your local machine using Git:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics.git
   ```
1.  Clone the `ultralytics` repository to your local machine using Git:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the cloned repository's root directory:

   ```

- This command installs the ultralytics package along with all development dependencies, allowing you to modify the package code and have the changes immediately reflected in your Python environment.
3.  Install the package in editable mode (`-e`) along with its development dependencies (`[dev]`) using [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/):
    ```bash
    pip install -e '.[dev]'
    ```
    This command installs the `ultralytics` package such that changes to the source code are immediately reflected in your environment, ideal for development.

## üöÄ Building and Serving Locally

The `mkdocs serve` command builds and serves a local version of your MkDocs documentation, ideal for development and testing:
The `mkdocs serve` command builds and serves a local version of your [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) documentation. This is highly useful during development and testing to preview changes.

```bash
mkdocs serve
```

- #### Command Breakdown:

  - `mkdocs` is the main MkDocs command-line interface.
  - `serve` is the subcommand to build and locally serve your documentation.

- üßê Note:

  - Grasp changes to the docs in real-time as `mkdocs serve` supports live reloading.
  - To stop the local server, press `CTRL+C`.
-   **Command Breakdown:**
    -   `mkdocs`: The main MkDocs command-line interface tool.
    -   `serve`: The subcommand used to build and locally serve your documentation site.
-   **Note:**
    -   `mkdocs serve` includes live reloading, automatically updating the preview in your browser as you save changes to the documentation files.
    -   To stop the local server, simply press `CTRL+C` in your terminal.

## üåç Building and Serving Multi-Language

Supporting multi-language documentation? Follow these steps:
If your documentation supports multiple languages, follow these steps to build and preview all versions:

1. Stage all new language \*.md files with Git:

   ```bash
   git add docs/**/*.md -f
   ```
1.  Stage all new or modified language Markdown (`.md`) files using Git:
    ```bash
    git add docs/**/*.md -f
    ```

2. Build all languages to the `/site` folder, ensuring relevant root-level files are present:

   ```bash
   # Clear existing /site directory
   rm -rf site
2.  Build all language versions into the `/site` directory. This script ensures that relevant root-level files are included and clears the previous build:
    ```bash
    # Clear existing /site directory to prevent conflicts
    rm -rf site

   # Loop through each language config file and build
   mkdocs build -f docs/mkdocs.yml
   for file in docs/mkdocs_*.yml; do
     echo "Building MkDocs site with $file"
     mkdocs build -f "$file"
   done
   ```
    # Build the default language site using the primary config file
    mkdocs build -f docs/mkdocs.yml

    # Loop through each language-specific config file and build its site
    for file in docs/mkdocs_*.yml; do
      echo "Building MkDocs site with $file"
      mkdocs build -f "$file"
    done
    ```

3. To preview your site, initiate a simple HTTP server:

   ```bash
   cd site
   python -m http.server
   # Open in your preferred browser
   ```

- üñ•Ô∏è Access the live site at `http://localhost:8000`.
3.  To preview the complete multi-language site locally, navigate into the build output directory and start a simple [Python HTTP server](https://docs.python.org/3/library/http.server.html):
    ```bash
    cd site
    python -m http.server
    # Open http://localhost:8000 in your preferred web browser
    ```
    Access the live preview site at `http://localhost:8000`.

## üì§ Deploying Your Documentation Site

Choose a hosting provider and deployment method for your MkDocs documentation:
To deploy your MkDocs documentation site, choose a hosting provider and configure your deployment method. Common options include [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), GitLab Pages, or other static site hosting services.

- Configure `mkdocs.yml` with deployment settings.
- Use `mkdocs deploy` to build and deploy your site.
-   Configure deployment settings within your `mkdocs.yml` file.
-   Use the `mkdocs deploy` command specific to your chosen provider to build and deploy your site.

* ### GitHub Pages Deployment Example:
  ```bash
  mkdocs gh-deploy
  ```
*   **GitHub Pages Deployment Example:**
    If deploying to GitHub Pages, you can use the built-in command:
    ```bash
    mkdocs gh-deploy
    ```
    After deployment, you might need to update the "Custom domain" settings in your repository's settings page if you wish to use a personalized URL.

- Update the "Custom domain" in your repository's settings for a personalized URL.
